    "question": "Why should I use correct indentation?",
    "answer": "To keep the overview. Code gets quickly very long and if you don't indent correctly you will find it really hard to keep track of which elements are inside which other elements and which tags belong together.<br>Plus for many employers it's a K.O. argument if the applicant doesn't indent correctly.",

    "question": "What do I need comments for and how do I use them best?",
    "answer": "Commenting is a good way to make your code more readable for yourself and others. Either people who work with you or possible employers or yourself a few weeks after writing the original code, all these people will highly appreciate well commented code. In JavaScript you can use it to explain functionality. In CSS you can use it to separate your code into groups (for example you can put stylings for specific pages in groups displayed with comments). In HTML It is often times extremly useful to put comments behind <strong>every single</strong> closing div tag. When you use Bootstrap it is very likely you end up having 3 or more div closing tags in a row. To keep track of which opening tag they belong to it is a good idea to put a comment behind each one of them with a description of which opening tag they belong to.",

    "question": "What is the difference between the CDN link to boostrap.css and the bootstrap.css file I downloaded and put in my project folder?",
    "answer": "Both files contain exatly the same code. So <strong>never include both files</strong> in your HTML head. The CDN link is faster to work with and can possibly lower load times for your user if he already accessed a website using Bootstrap before. Downloading the bootstrap.css allows you to be independent from other servers. Also you can <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/customize/\" target=\"blank\">customize the Bootstrap CSS</a> and take out elements you don't need to save load time.",

    "answer": "Check the 'head' of your website and make sure to put <strong>all</strong> your script tags <strong>below</strong> your link tags. JavaScript files always come at the bottom and all your CSS needs to be above them to make sure everything loads properly.",
