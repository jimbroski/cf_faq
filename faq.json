    "question": "Why should I use correct indentation? How do I indent correctly?",
    "answer": "To keep the overview. Code gets quickly very long and if you don't indent correctly you will find it really hard to keep track of which elements are inside which other elements and which tags belong together.<br>Generally speaking you indent everything that's between an opening &#60...&#62 and closing tag &#60/...&#62 once.<br> An example might look like this:<p><span>&#60parent&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent1\">&#60first-child&#62</span>some content<span>&#60/first-child&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent1\">&#60second-child&#62</span>some content<span>&#60/second-child&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent1\">&#60third-child&#62</span>some content<span>&#60/third-child&#62</span><br> <span>&#60/parent&#62</span></p> Notice how all three children are indented on the same level. That's because their closing tags are before the next opening tag. That's why they are also called siblings because they are all children of the same parents.<br> Just like in a real family children can become parents again. That's how we get multiple indentations: <p><span class=\"orange\">&#60great_grandparent&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent1 pink\">&#60grandparents1&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent2 red\">&#60parents1&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent3 blue\">&#60child1&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent4 green\">&#60grandchild&#62</span>some content<span class=\"green\">&#60/grandchild&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent3 blue\">&#60/child1&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent3 blue\">&#60child2&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent4 green\">Some content</span><br> <span class=\"indent3 blue\">&#60/child2&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent2 red\">&#60/parents1&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent2 red\">&#60parents2&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent3 blue\">Some content</span><br> <span class=\"indent2 red\">&#60/parents2&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent1 pink\">&#60/grandparents1&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent1 pink\">&#60grandparents2&#62</span><br> <span class=\"indent2 red\">Some content</span><br> <span class=\"indent1 pink\">&#60/grandparents2&#62</span><br> <span class=\"orange\">&#60/great_grandparent&#62</span></p>",

    "question": "What do I need comments for and how do I use them best?",
    "answer": "Commenting is a good way to make your code more readable for yourself and others. Either people who work with you or possible employers or yourself a few weeks after writing the original code, all these people will highly appreciate well commented code. In JavaScript you can use it to explain functionality. In CSS you can use it to separate your code into groups (for example you can put stylings for specific pages in groups displayed with comments). In HTML It is often times extremly useful to put comments behind <strong>every single</strong> closing div tag. When you use Bootstrap it is very likely you end up having 3 or more div closing tags in a row. To keep track of which opening tag they belong to it is a good idea to put a comment behind each one of them with a description of which opening tag they belong to.",

    "question": "What is the difference between the CDN link to boostrap.css and the bootstrap.css file I downloaded and put in my project folder?",
    "answer": "Both files contain exatly the same code. So <strong>never include both files</strong> in your HTML head. The CDN link is faster to work with and can possibly lower load times for your user if he already accessed a website using Bootstrap before. Downloading the bootstrap.css allows you to be independent from other servers. Also you can <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/customize/\" target=\"blank\">customize the Bootstrap CSS</a> and take out elements you don't need to save load time.",
