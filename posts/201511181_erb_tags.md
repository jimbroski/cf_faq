#### Review ERB syntax


Now in Ruby on Rails you have another type of files `.erb` and this type allows you to add Ruby code inside "ERB tags”. You can and have to still use the exact same HTML syntax you have learned before. Nothing changed in terms of that. HTML looks still exactly the same way. Only **in addition to** the HTML code you also have a new type of tags: ERB tags. ERB tags actually come in two different versions:  `<% … %>` and `<%= %>`
Inside those tags you have to write pure Ruby code. **Outside** of them you can NOT use Ruby code and you have to always stick  to normal HTML code syntax (as we talked about above).
Ruby is a programming language with features like loops, conditionals, variables, objects and so on. You learned about Ruby before. With ERB tags you are able to write Ruby logic in the middle of your HTML code. That’s particularly  useful to access variables and that’s what you are doing on your Rails page.
But first let’s get back to the two types of ERB tags:
- `<% … %>` will run everything inside of it but NOT output anything on the HTML page. What this could look like practically I’m going to show you in just a minute:
- `<%= … %>` on the other hand will run the code inside of it and then output the result on the HTML page in the middle of the rest of your HTML code.
So what does that look like? On any of your ERB pages (doesn’t matter which one. Take for example views/static_pages/index.html.erb) add the following ERB code at the beginning:
